          <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Christopher Comito. I am 23 year old graduate from Rowan
              University activley pursuing a career in the tech field. Upon graduating highschool in 2019 I decided 
              to pursue a career in the automotive industry, enrolling at Camden County College
              in thier GM ASEP program. I learned a great deal about how to be an ideal
              technician while also getting my Associates Degree in Automotive technology.
              After graduating from Camden County I stayed in the industry for another year
              at which I decided to return back to school and pursue a bachelors degree 
              in Computing and Informatics. I felt with my diagnostic abilities and knowledge
              in electrical I would be able to excel in the tech field. Going to school I learned
              how to write code, make websites, work with data, hardware, 
              software, cloud computing, and daily operations of a IT professional.
              From my past expirences I gained many positive traits such as I am hardworking,
              self motivation, willingness to learn, and I have a strong sense of time management.
              I think with this I've built a strong foundation for myself and am looking foward
              to learning and growing with where ever my professional life will go next.
